# ltc-chibichip-hardware

This repository contains the design files for the Chibi Chip
microcontroller, in the [preferred format for
modification](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/), which is [Altium
Designer 17](http://www.altium.com/free-trial) or later.  In addition,
the schematics have been converted to PDF format.

The hardware is consistent with the pre-production release. No changes
are anticipated for production modulo some silkscreen tweaks to update
version codes, dates and legal notices.

This repository carries a [CERN OHL 1.2
license](http://www.ohwr.org/licenses/cern-ohl/v1.2). Please read it,
but if you're too lazy, take note that it does not give you a license
to use the Chibitronics trademarks, and it is a copyleft-style
license, so any derivatives also inherit this license.

Looking for the Chibi Scope hardware files? They ended up getting checked
into the source code repo for the Chibi Scope OS:
