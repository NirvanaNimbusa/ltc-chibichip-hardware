# ltc-chibichip-hardware

This repository contains the design files for the Chibi Chip
microcontroller, in the [preferred format for
modification](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/), which is [Altium
Designer 17](http://www.altium.com/free-trial) or later.  In addition,
the schematics have been converted to PDF format.

The hardware is consistent with the pre-production release. No changes
are anticipated for production modulo some silkscreen tweaks to update
version codes, dates and legal notices.

but if you're too lazy, take note that it does not give you a license
to use the Chibitronics trademarks, and it is a copyleft-style
